First demo in index.html
Intent of this Project:

1. Provide an input text field for searching images.

2. Using Google Feed API get public images based on the search input from Flickr.

3. Images should be displayed in the page and the page should support infinite scrolling which should pull more images from Flickr for displaying if required.

4. Add your own style to make it looks good.

Google Feed API : 

https://developers.google.com/feed/v1/jsondevguide

Flickr API:
https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/

How it works:
1. Unzip the zip file
2. In the folder so created. Launch on index.html in browser
4. Enter type of Image you are looking for in the Search box
3. Click on Go button
5. Resulting Images will be displayed in panel below Search
6. Scroll images would call the feeds again and append the result

Enhancements left:
1. Scrolling is working but I am not able to find how to get the next set of results from flickr feed
2. Improve on CSS
